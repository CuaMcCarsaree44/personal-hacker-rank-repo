# Personal Hacker Rank Repo
This repository contains my progress regarding my personal training in HackerRank. 
My first motivation on doing this was to learn some programming languages that are related with .NET. 

## Getting used to things
Getting used on things and actually adapt to changes could be hard, especially if you have a large number of experiences in previous programming languages.

You may want to change the programming paradigm and re-train your mindset to adapt on the new programming behaviors to adapt to the new programming language. In this case, I want to learn and actually trying my best to be good on C# and F#. 

I started to code with C# once again when the first time this repository was created. September, 3rd 2023. When I said **once again**, it was 2018 in college. 
Started to code with F# by September, 27th 2023.
